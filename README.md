# Candidate Management Suite

## The purpose of your application 
 I want to develop a tool that streamlines the candidate management process, from application receipt to interview scheduling and feedback collection.

## About your application
With Contember, I will build a tool that streamlines the candidate management process. This tool will handle tasks such as receiving applications, scheduling interviews, and collecting feedback. It will provide a user-friendly interface and integrate with a PostgreSQL database. The application will be built using the Contember open-source framework, allowing for easy modification and customization. At the end of the process, the generated application can be deployed to Contember Cloud for testing and further development. Additionally, the code written in Contember can be downloaded for local development.
